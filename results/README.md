**results/model-outputs** <br>
Results we obtained from paraphrasing with different translators and models. Names of the files indicatesmodel, compiler and number of epochs used for training (T5_Clarin_50 means T5 model trained on sentences gained from Clarin translator trained on 50 epoch).
 contains sentences for testing and evaluation of models.

**results/automatic-evaluation-scores** <br>
Results obtained from automatically evaluating the paraphrases from results/model-outputs and results/t5-choice.

**results/human-evaluation-scores** <br>
Human evaluation of a few outputs from results/model-outputs and results/t5-choice.

**results/t5-choice** <br>
Chosen outputs for T5 models, based on perplexity score.
